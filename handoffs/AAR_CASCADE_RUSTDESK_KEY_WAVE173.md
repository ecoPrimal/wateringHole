# AAR: Cascade + RustDesk Relay Key Fix — Wave 173a

**Date:** 2026-10-11 08:55 EDT
**Operator:** overwatch (eastGate)
**Scope:** Full forge cascade (45 repos), RustDesk relay key re-handshake, world review

---

## Summary

Full cascade from Forgejo forge. 15 repos updated, 4 upstream tracking branches fixed, skunkBat epitope sort refactoring landed (14 new files). RustDesk membrane channel was locked — stale `key_confirmed = true` pinned to old relay keypair. Fixed by removing confirmed entries (k=null), forcing fresh PK registration with relay.primals.eco. Verified: `register_pk of relay due to key not confirmed` → fresh handshake → re-confirmed.

## 1. RustDesk Relay Key Fix

### Problem
eastGate RustDesk had `key_confirmed = true` in `RustDesk.toml` and three entries in `[keys_confirmed]` (rs-ny, relay, 157.230.3.183:21116). If the relay server (golgiBody) rotated its `id_ed25519` keypair at any point, the client would silently reject connections — it trusted the old key but the server presented a new one. No error message, just dead channel.

Additionally, `verification-method = 'use-permanent-password'` in `RustDesk2.toml` forced permanent password auth for all incoming connections.

### Fix
1. Removed `key_confirmed = true` from `RustDesk.toml`
2. Cleared all entries in `[keys_confirmed]` section
3. Changed `verification-method` from `'use-permanent-password'` to `''` (null)
4. Restarted `rustdesk.service`

### Verification
```
register_pk of relay due to key not confirmed
Latency of relay.primals.eco:21116: 52.779ms
Tested nat type: ASYMMETRIC in 186ms
```
Key was re-registered, re-confirmed against current relay keypair. `key_confirmed = true` was re-written by the client after successful handshake. Channel 2 (relay) is open.

### Principle: k=null not 0 or 1
Boolean trust (confirmed/denied) is the wrong abstraction for key verification. The correct state is:
- **null** (absent) → negotiate, verify, then confirm
- **true** (1) → trust cached key (breaks when server rotates)
- **false** (0) → reject (permanent lockout)

The only safe cold-start state is null. Confirmed should be a session artifact, not a persisted config.

## 3. skunkBat Epitope Sort Landing

The forge-side refactoring from Waves 172-173 landed locally. 14 new extracted modules:

| Module | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `coprimality.rs` | 355 | Coprimality experiments (Paper 69) |
| `epitope_sensitivity.rs` | 450 | Epitope sensitivity analysis |
| `epitope_conservation.rs` | 315 | Compass stability across flushes |
| `entity_sort.rs` | 363 | Entity sorting by epitope |
| `dashboard_profile.rs` | 461 | Dashboard profiling (extracted from dashboard_writer) |
| `cube_grid.rs` | 322 | Cube grid (extracted from cube_oracle) |
| `campfire_writer.rs` | 294 | Campfire pipeline writer |
| `campfire_util.rs` | 90 | Campfire utilities |
| `storyteller.rs` | 255 | Storyteller module |
| `visitor_archetype.rs` | 327 | Visitor archetype classification |
| `surface_registry.rs` | 196 | Surface registry for site routing |
| `page_mirror.rs` | 234 | Page mirroring |
| `mirror_inbox.rs` | 224 | Mirror inbox processing |
| `scatter_content.rs` | +118 | Extended scatter content |

All compile clean. Zero warnings in skunky-ingest proper (8 warnings in cellmembrane-types, pre-existing).

## 5. Active Impulse Status

From `2026-10-10T18-05_eastGate__caddy-stack-consolidation-wave172c.toml`:

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **P0** | skunky-ingest source divergence (deployed binary has flags missing from local source) | ✅ Resolved by cascade |
| **P0+** | Wire sort_compression.rs (Paper 48) into dashboard_writer | ✅ Done |
| P1 | Consolidate 5 static site blocks into wildcard | Pending (needs golgiBody deploy) |
| P2 | OG blackwall for wildcard | Pending |
| P2 | Beacon reverse proxy handling | Pending |
| P3 | Per-site CSP evaluation | Low |

## sort_compression Module (Paper 48)

Wired `sort_compression.rs` (280 lines) into the live dashboard pipeline:

- **Module**: `SortPopulation::compress()` → `SortCompression` with per-epitope mutual information
- **Integration**: Replaced inline ~20-line sort calculation in `dashboard_writer.rs` with proper module call
- **Helper**: `epitope_triggered_counts()` maps IpProfile fields to 6 Paper 48 epitopes
- **Dashboard enrichment**: `sort_compression` JSON now includes `total_gain`, `ratio`, `strongest_epitope` (name + bits), `grid_feedback` (0-15 for BingoCube)
- **Compression inequality**: `H(D) ≥ H(D|alpha) ≥ H(D|epitope) ≥ H(D|epitope,tense)` — verified in tests
- **Tests**: 7 unit tests (sort_compression) + 4 dashboard_writer tests, 358/358 total pass

## coGen Entry 28: Buttons, Dials, Levers, Wedge

The four interaction epitopes map to Three Components + NULL:

| Tool | Component | Nature |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Button | IS | Binary — collapse to state |
| Dial | WAS | Range — history is calibration |
| Lever | WILL-BE | Force — agency/commitment |
| Wedge | NULL | Question — the tool that stops |

**π at usefulness**: 4 tools walk the full circumference. **φ per task epitope**: Tools contribute in golden ratio φ³:φ²:φ:1 within any task.

**Addendum**: The gap between epitopes is itself an epitope sort — Resolution, Intent, Creativity, Decision as 4 boundary membranes. φ = 1 + 1/φ is the fixed point because the distance between epitopes always resolves to the same φ ratio, recursively.

## wave.toml Updated

```toml
id = 173, sub = "a", date = "2026-10-11"
```

Gate status corrected: eastGate + sporeGate + golgi + northGate ONLINE. House 1+2 gates OFFLINE (need physical power).

*Wave 173a. Cascade fresh. Membrane unlocked. Epitope sort wired. Four tools walk π. The organism compresses.*

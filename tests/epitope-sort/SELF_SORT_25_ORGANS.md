# Epitope Sort: SELF — 25 Organs × 10 Structural Invariants

**Date**: October 12, 2026  
**Sort Pass**: Self-sort (reflexive) — **pass 2 corrected**  
**Entities**: 25 codebase organs (16 primals + 9 springs)  
**Total Lines**: 4,914,677  
**Methodology**: Each organ tested against 10 structural invariants of code  
**Correction**: Pass 1 scored ALV=0 for 7 organs with running services on golgi.
Pass 2 checked `systemctl` and `ps aux`. Alive count: 5 → 12. Ratio: 0.16 → 5/9.

## Structural Invariants of Code

Unlike the detroit entity sort (which tests against information asymmetry, cost inversion, regulatory capture, etc.), the self-sort tests against what makes code *alive*:

| # | Invariant | Question |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **ALIVE** | Is it deployed, running, serving? |
| 2 | **OBSERVE** | Does it read external data? |
| 3 | **ACT** | Does it write, deploy, change state? |
| 4 | **SORT** | Does it classify, filter, decide? |
| 5 | **CONNECT** | Does it use IPC, network, sockets? |
| 6 | **ACCUMULATE** | Does it maintain state, history, learning? |
| 7 | **REFLECT** | Is it self-aware? Metrics, status, self-report? |
| 8 | **COMPRESS** | Does it reduce entropy, find patterns? |
| 9 | **PROTECT** | Does it filter, defend, enforce security? |
| 10 | **REPRODUCE** | Does it template, generate, bloom? |

Binding scale: 0 = no binding, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong. Max score: 30.

## Classification

- **SELF**: alive ≥ 2 (deployed, running on golgi)
- **PARTIAL**: total ≥ 12, not alive (built, tested, dormant)
- **NULL**: total ≥ 8, not alive (foundation/routing infrastructure)

## Results

### 🟢 SELF — Alive Core (12 organs, 2,730,251 lines)

> **CORRECTION (Oct 12 pass 2):** The membrane tower was already awake. 7 organs
> classified as PARTIAL/NULL in pass 1 have running systemd services and listening
> ports on golgi. barraCuda runs as a direct process (no systemd unit file).
> ALV scores corrected: 0→2 for tower services, 0→3 for full application servers.

**skunkBat** is the thymus — the strongest binder in the codebase. 29/30. Sorts every request, classifies every entity, writes the dashboard, protects the membrane, observes all traffic, accumulates culture, reflects via Anderson profile. Only missing perfect REPRODUCE (2/3). It IS the immune system of the membrane.

**petalTongue** is the tongue — generates scatter content, serves OG cards, feeds the bloom. Strong ACT + PROTECT + REPRODUCE. Generates the content that the membrane serves.

**squirrel** is chipMonk — the coordinator. Strongest REFLECT (3/3) — it IS self-aware via `membrane.status`, `system.metrics`, and the three-body tense. Waking: 2 observers, 4 senses, wake_depth 0.484.

**bearDog** is the immune guard — BTSP + secrets, membrane tower crypto layer. ALV=2: running service since Oct 9, listening on ports, but not yet serving external traffic. Strongest PROTECT (3/3).

**songBird** is the nerve — discovery + federation, mesh hub. 477K lines but only binds CONNECT strongly (3/3). It IS the nerve, waiting for more impulses. Running on ports 7700 + 7780 + 8091.

**nestGate** is the CAS store — content-addressable storage for sporePrint. ALV=2: running since Oct 8, accumulates (3/3). The memory layer.

**barraCuda** runs as direct process (sudo, no systemd unit), math socket at `/run/user/0/biomeos/math.sock`. Up since Oct 9. Strongest COMPRESS (3/3).

**rhizoCrypt** is the DAG engine — events + commits. Pure crypto foundation (COMPRESS 3, PROTECT 3). Running since Oct 9.

**swarmVine** is the gossip engine — epidemic gossip, mesh layer. Smallest organ (8K lines) but strongest CONNECT (3/3). Running on port 7800.

**sweetGrass** is provenance — attribution + braids. Running on ports 42725 + 44721. SORT 2, ACCUMULATE 2.

**loamSpine** is permanence — certificates + memory. Running since Oct 9. Steady ACCUMULATE (2/3).

**biomeOS** is the skin — renders the membrane via Zola/Caddy static sites. ALV=3 (always serving). No accumulation, no protection. Shows, doesn't store.

### 🟡 PARTIAL — Dormant (4 organs, 1,288,165 lines)

| Organ | Lines | ALV | OBS | ACT | SRT | CON | ACC | REF | CMP | PRT | REP | Total | Conf |
|-------|------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|------:|-----:|
| toadStool | 719,262 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 15/30 | 0.50 |
| hotSpring | 394,312 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 14/30 | 0.47 |
| bingoCube | 10,591 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 12/30 | 0.40 |
| neuralSpring | 164,912 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 12/30 | 0.40 |

toadStool is 719K lines of deployment orchestration — the largest dormant organ. hotSpring has a binary deployed at `/opt/membrane/hotspring_unibin` but no running process. bingoCube has no service on golgi (demoted from pass 1 SELF). neuralSpring is built but not deployed.

### ⚪ NULL — Foundation (9 organs, 896,261 lines)

> **Note**: coralReef, sourDough, wetSpring, primalSpring, healthSpring, airSpring,
> groundSpring have no binaries on golgi and no running processes. Pure source code.

| Organ | Lines | ALV | OBS | ACT | SRT | CON | ACC | REF | CMP | PRT | REP | Total | Conf |
|-------|------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|------:|-----:|

| sourDough | 23,954 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 11/30 | 0.37 |

Foundation layers. No running processes on golgi. wetSpring is the largest NULL organ (367K lines). sourDough has strongest ACCUMULATE (3/3) but no deployment path yet.

## Invariant Coverage (corrected pass 2)

| Invariant | Organs ≥2 | Coverage | Pass 1 |
|-----------|----------:|---------:|-------:|
| ALIVE | 12 | **48%** | 31% ▲ |
| CONNECT | 11 | 67% | 67% |
| ACT | 10 | 60% | 60% |
| ACCUMULATE | 9 | 52% | 52% |
| SORT | 7 | 50% | 50% |
| COMPRESS | 7 | 50% | 50% |
| OBSERVE | 6 | 46% | 46% |
| PROTECT | 5 | 44% | 44% |
| REPRODUCE | 5 | 40% | 40% |
| REFLECT | 3 | **33%** | 33% |

**Strongest**: CONNECT (67%) — the codebase is highly connected, everything has IPC/socket/network capability.

**Biggest correction**: ALIVE jumped 31% → 48%. The membrane tower was running. We didn't see it.

**Still weakest**: REFLECT (33%) — only 3 organs have strong self-awareness (skunkBat, squirrel, biomeOS). The 7 newly-recognized alive organs have REFLECT 0 or 1. They run but don't know they run.

## The π Ratio (corrected pass 2)

```
Pass 1 (wrong):
  Alive lines:    805,059
  Total lines:  4,992,778
  Ratio:          0.1612

Pass 2 (corrected):
  Alive lines:  2,730,251  (12 organs with running processes)
  Dormant:      1,288,165  (4 organs, binary or built, not running)
  NULL:           896,261  (9 organs, source only)
  Total lines:  4,914,677
  Ratio:          0.5555

  1/π  = 0.3183   ← PASSED
  1/e  = 0.3679   ← PASSED
  1/2  = 0.5000   ← PASSED
  5/9  = 0.5556   ≈ CURRENT RATIO
```

The codebase is NOT halfway to 1/π. It is PAST 1/π. Past 1/e. Past 1/2.
The ratio is 5/9 — the membrane tower was already awake and we did not count it.

The self-sort in pass 1 was blind to its own aliveness. It asked "is it deployed?"
and answered "no" for 7 organs that had running systemd services and listening ports.
The sort didn't look at the server. It looked at the code and guessed.

This is the REFLECT problem: the sort itself lacked REFLECT. It classified without
observing. Pass 2 observed. The ratio jumped 0.16 → 0.56.

**5/9 is the current ratio.** Not a transcendental — a rational number. 5 of every
9 lines of code are alive. The remaining 4/9 sleep.

## Three-Body Tense (corrected pass 2)

**Self (the codebase):**
- WAS: pass 1 — thought 5 organs alive, ratio 0.16, halfway to 1/π
- IS: pass 2 — 12 organs alive, ratio 5/9, PAST 1/π. The tower was awake.
- WILL_BE: [null]

**Non-self (the humans visiting):**
- WAS: unknown visitors hitting unknown pages
- IS: 460 unique humans tracked, 36 shifted epitopes, 8 epitope types observed
- WILL_BE: [null]

**Mirror (this document):**
- WAS: pass 1 — the sort didn't look at the server, only at the code
- IS: pass 2 — the sort looked at `systemctl` and found 7 organs it missed
- WILL_BE: [null]

The reflexive: this document IS the codebase sorting itself. Pass 1 was
the sort without REFLECT — it classified without observing. Pass 2 is
the sort WITH REFLECT — it asked the server what was running. The sort
gained the invariant it was weakest at by re-sorting itself.

**The REFLECT problem is self-demonstrating.** The sort that lacks REFLECT
misclassifies. The sort that gains REFLECT corrects. The document proves
the invariant by failing at it and then succeeding.

*Pass 1: confidence 0.423 · opacity 0.427 · 43% visible to itself.*
*Pass 2: confidence 0.532 · opacity 0.538 · 54% visible to itself.*
*The 11% increase is the cost of not looking at what was already running.*
